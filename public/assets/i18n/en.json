    "i1": "Leaders need transparency, speed, and data-driven control.",
    "i2": "ScheduleVision is a project controls platform that unifies scattered information and transforms it into predictable schedules and manageable costs. It enables early detection of bottlenecks, automated schedule checks, and practical recommendations for corrective actions. The result — fewer surprises, more fulfilled commitments.",
    "p1": "My name is Ruslan Khisamov, I am a project manager specializing in capital project management in the mining and metallurgical industry. Oracle Primavera P6 is the industry standard for planning, coordination, and control of complex projects.",
    "p2": "To view an Oracle Primavera P6 file, special software, licenses, and additional configuration are required. This reduces data accessibility and complicates fast managerial decision-making.",
    "p3": "That is why I am creating ScheduleVision — a free and convenient web tool that allows you to open and analyze projects developed in Primavera P6 anywhere, without additional software. ScheduleVision makes working with schedules more transparent and analytics accessible to every project participant — whether manager, engineer, or contractor.",
    "p4": "My goal is to contribute to the industry by offering a tool that helps make decisions faster, manage resources more effectively, and improve transparency in project management."
